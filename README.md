# DS-ASSIGNMENT
In the first assignment which was to predict the price of house I did some cleaning of the data then I did feature enginerring (creation of new features as well as some feature selection part),after this I used Linear regression,KNN,SVM,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Ada boost,Gradient Boost,Voting ensemble method,Bagging regressor and the metric I used was r2 score to calculate the accuracy of my model and I found out that the Random Forest was performing very well
In the second the assignment I used Kmeans clustering to group similiar products on the flipkart and amazon .
